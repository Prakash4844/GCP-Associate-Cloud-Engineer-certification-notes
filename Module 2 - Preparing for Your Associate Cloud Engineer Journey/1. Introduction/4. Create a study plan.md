One of the primary goals for this course is to help you devise a study strategy that focuses on areas you need to work on. The course and your course workbook focuses on each section of the Exam Guide in turn. To help you craft a study strategy, you'll take diagnostic questions as part of each module.

Many of these questions will ask you to apply concepts you will need to be familiar with as an Associate Cloud Engineer. You can take these questions either using Google Forms or using your workbook.

Keep in mind that these diagnostic questions are meant to help you identify gaps in your knowledge, but they don't represent all possible topics on the exam. Remember, we don't expect that you'll answer all these questions correctly right now.

As we cover each objective, you'll learn more about where the key concepts appear in the Google Cloud documentation, specific courses and modules, and/or specific skill badges. At the end of each section objective, you'll find a list of related resources, mark or highlight the specific resources you need to add to your study plan.

In the final part of your workbook, you'll find a template to help you identify weekly goals and study activities.
